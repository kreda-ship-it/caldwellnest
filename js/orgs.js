// ============================================================
//
// *** NOTHING IN THIS FILE IS SECURITY. READ THIS BEFORE USING ANY OF IT. ***
//
// orgCanAct() below is a MIRROR of the can_act() function in Postgres, and it exists for
// exactly one purpose: deciding whether to draw a button. It runs in the browser, where the
// person using it can open the console and make it return whatever they like.
//
// The real enforcement is Row Level Security, defined in sql/2026-09-04_org_hierarchy.sql
// and proven by sql/2026-09-04_verify_can_act.sql. If a student forces this function to
// return true, the button appears and the database still refuses the write.
//
// This is the standing project rule, and it is a launch blocker when broken: UI-only gating
// is not gating. Never move a permission decision here from the database. If you find
// yourself wanting to, what you actually want is a new flag and a new policy.
//
// The mirror can be WRONG in exactly one direction, and that is on purpose. RLS may hide an
// organization row from this browser — an inactive club the user does not manage, say — and
// the ancestor walk below then stops early and answers false where the database would answer
// true. A hidden button where one was allowed is a nuisance. A visible button that leads to a
// refused write is worse, and a visible button that WORKS when it should not is the thing
// that must never happen. So this fails closed.
//
// Kept deliberately lazy: nothing here loads at boot. A student with no memberships — which
// is almost every student — never pays for a query they do not use. Call loadOrgContext()
// when you are about to draw something that needs it.
// ============================================================

// The whole cache. null means "never loaded"; that is distinct from "loaded and found
// nothing", which is an object with empty maps. Code that cannot tell those apart ends up
// re-querying on every render.
let _orgCtx = null;

// Mirrors the CASE expression inside can_act(). If a flag is ever added to org_memberships,
// it goes here AND in the SQL function, and the two must agree. They are checked against each
// other by nothing — that is the cost of a mirror, and the reason this map is small.
